 * \page probability Probability of events
 *
 * Probability throughout the simulations is handled using pre-rolled random numbers
 * based on a fixed seed, so that simulation results are reproducible.
 *
 * Probability is stored as 'thresholds' for a certain event on a day-by-day and hour-by-hour
 * basis. If the calculated probability of that type of event matches or exceeds the threshold
 * then the event will occur.
 *
 * Each iteration of a scenario will have its own thresholds, and thus different behaviour
 * can occur with the same input indices.
 *
 * Thresholds are used to determine:
 * - extinction
 * - spread events
