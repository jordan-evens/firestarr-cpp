 * The fuel, slope, aspect, and elevation used in simulations is consistent through
 * all simulations. These attributes are loaded from rasters at the start of the
 * process. These rasters must be in a UTM projection, and all rasters for a zone
 * must be named consistently across the different attributes. The GIS scripts
 * provided in the FireSTARR project can generate these rasters for you.
 *
 * Elevation is only read at the ignition point and it is assumed that elevation
 * is the same wherever it is used in a calculation. Despite this, slope and aspect
 * are used for calculations in each cell, and it is only where elevation is
 * specifically used in a formula that this value is referenced.
 *
 * Fuel requires a .lut lookup table file, in the same format that Prometheus
 * expects.
 *
 * Grass curing and leaf-on/off are determined based on time of year, as described
 * elsewhere.
 *
 * Weather and ignition point(s) are the only things that vary between simulations
 * at this point.
